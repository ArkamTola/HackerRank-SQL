Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths.
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

Solution :-

SELECT CASE
    WHEN (A + B <= C) OR (B + C <= A) OR (A + C <= B) THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN (A = B) AND (B = C) THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN ((A = B) AND (A != C)) OR ((B = C) AND (B != A))OR ((A = C) AND (A != B)) THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
  END AS Triangle_Type
FROM TRIANGLES;
